title: "Distributing Extensions"
---

## Overview

Quarto extensions are directories that contain an `_extensions` sub-directory with one or more extensions. The files above the `_extensions` directory are not installed, so typically contain README and LICENSE files, examples, test cases, etc.

There are two distinct ways to distribute extensions to end users:

1.  Publish your extension in a public GitHub repository.

2.  Bundle your extension into a `.zip` or `.tar.gz` archive.

Each method has benefits and drawbacks that will be explored below. First we'll cover the basic file structure and contents of an extension.

## Extension Contents

Quarto Extensions are directories that contain an `_extensions` folder that contains one or more extension contributions. While the most common case is the distribution of a single extension, it is possible to create a single extension directory that includes multiple shortcodes, multiple filters, or a combination of both.

Here is the contents of an extension named `my-filter`:

``` default
README.md
LICENSE
example.qmd
_extensions/
  my-filter/
    _extension.yml
    my-filter.lua
```

Note that the only thing strictly required is the `_extensions` directory (anything above that is for your own purposes and is ignored during installation). Even so, it's good practice to include a `README.md` and `LICENSE` file, and the `example.qmd` will be useful for developing your extension.

### \_extension.yml

Each extension is defined by its `_extension.yml` file which contains the metadata about the extension as well as the what items it contributes when used. For example, here is the `_extension.yml` for a filter extension:

``` yaml
title: My Filter
author: Cooltools
version: 1.0.0
contributes:
  filters:
    - my-filter.lua
```

Here are all of the fields that can be specified in the `_extension.yml` file:

`title`

:   The extension's name

`author`

:   The author of the extension

`version`

:   A semantic version number this release. When installing, updating, or releasing an extension, this version number will be used to present a summary of actions to the user.

`contributes`

:   The items that this extension will contribute to the render. There are two allowed subkeys:

::: {style="margin-left: 1em;"}

`shortcodes`

:   A list of shortcode files that should be loaded when this extension is installed.

`filters`

:   A list of filters that should be loaded when this extension is included in the list of filters used to render a document or project. The order of the filters in this list will be preserved.

`formats`

:   A record containing the key value pairs of output formats and the metadata associated with that output format.

## GitHub Distribution

Distributing extensions on GitHub has a number of benefits, including compact syntax (e.g. `quarto install extension org-name/extension`), the use of organizations as a "namespace" for managing name conflicts, and the ability to install specific releases or tags.

For example, the extensions in the [`quarto-ext`](https://github.com/quarto-ext/) GitHub organization can be installed with these commands:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto install extension quarto-ext/lightbox
quarto install extension quarto-ext/fontawesome
```

By default, extensions are installed from the `HEAD` of the `main` branch of the repository. You can also install from tags and/or branches in your repository by including an `@` after the repository name. For example:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto install extension quarto-ext/lightbox@v1.2
quarto install extension quarto-ext/lightbox@bugfix-22
```

Extensions installed from GitHub have another special property: the GitHub organization can be used as a namespace qualifier to disambiguate extensions that have the same name. For example, if you have two different `lightbox` extensions installed, you explicitly specify the `quarto-ext` one as follows:

``` yaml
---
filters:
  - quarto-ext/lightbox
---
```

## Archive Distribution

Distributing extensions as a `.zip` or `.tar.gz` archive has the benefit of not requiring public distribution. These extensions can also be installed directly from non-GitHub version control services using the archive URLs normally provided for repositories.

Note that unlike GitHub hosted extensions, extensions installed from archives do not have an organizational namespace (they all share a single namespace).

### Git Repositories

To install an extension from a GitLab repository you could do this:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto install extension https://gitlab.com/cooltools/shorty/-/archive/main/shorty-main.zip
```

You'll note that the above URL references the `main` branch. You can similarly install from any other branch, tag, or release. For example, to install the `v1.0` tag:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto install extension https://gitlab.com/cooltools/shorty/-/archive/v1.0/shorty-main.zip
```

If you are using BitBucket, Azure DevOps, or another Git hosting provider, consult the appropriate service documentation to learn how to form archive URLs for repositories.

### Archive Files

The above examples demonstrate installing from a Git repository, you can also install from an archive published to an ordinary web host. For example:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto install extension https://cooltools.org/quarto/shorty.zip
```

Or alternatively from a local archive file or even ordinary uncompressed directory:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto install extension ~/Downloads/shorty.zip
quarto install extension /share/quarto/extensions/shorty
```
